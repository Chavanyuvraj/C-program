//oops -classes and objects

//c++ --> initially called --> c with classes  by stroustroup
//class --> extention of structure(in c)
//structures had limotations
// -members are public 
// -No methods 
//classes --> structures+more
// classes-->can have methods and properties
//  classes --> can make few member as private and few as public 
// structers in c++ are typedefed
// you can declare objects along with the class declarion like this:
/*   class employee{
    class defination 

}   harry,yuva shubham;*/
//  harry.salary=8 makes no sense if salary is private
//  Nesting of member functions
